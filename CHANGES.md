Changes between Memfault Firmware SDK 0.0.7 and 0.0.6

- Added firmware side support for the Memfault Cloud **chunk** endpoint. This is
  a sessionless endpoint that allows chunks of arbitrary size to be sent and
  reassembled in the Memfault Cloud. The data is read out on the SDK side by
  calling the `memfault_packetizer_get_next()` API in `data_packetizer.h`. More
  details [here](https://mflt.io/2MGMoIl)
- Updated demo apps to use the new **chunk** endpoint
- Added a new _weak_ function, `memfault_coredump_read()` so platform ports can
  easily add locking on reads to coredump storage if necessary for transmission.
- Updates to this version of the sdk will require the **util** component get
  compiled when using the **panics** API

Changes between Memfault Firmware SDK 0.0.6 and 0.0.5 - Oct 14, 2019

- Added example port and demo for the STM32H743I-NUCLEO144 evaluation board
  running ChibiOS. See `platforms/stm32/stm32h743i/README.md` for more details.
- general README documentation improvements
- Fixed compilation error that could arise in `memfault_fault_handling_arm.c`
  when using old versions of GCC

Changes between Memfault Firmware SDK 0.0.5 and 0.0.4 - September 23, 2019

- Updated **panics** SDK to support complex hardware toplogies such as systems
  with multiple MCUs or systems running multiple binaries on a single MCU. More
  details [here](https://mflt.io/34PyNGQ). Users of the SDK will need to update
  the implementation for `memfault_platform_get_device_info()`
- Updated all ports to be in sync with SDK updates

Changes between Memfault Firmware SDK 0.0.4 and 0.0.3 - August 19, 2019

- Updated **panics** core code to _always_ collect fault registers for ARMv6-M &
  ARMv7-M architectures. The Memfault Cloud will auto-analyze these and present
  an analysis.
- Updated https://try.memfault.com gdb script to collect Cortex-M MPU region
  information for auto-analysis
- general README documentation improvements
- improved error reporting strategy and documentation in
  `memfault/core/errors.h`

Changes between Memfault Firmware SDK 0.0.3 and 0.0.2 - July 2, 2019

- added example port and demo of **panics** SDK for the Nordic nRF52840
  (PCA10056) development kit. See `platforms/nrf5/README.md` for more details.
- Made SDK headers suitable for includion in C++ files

First Public Release of Memfault Firmware SDK 0.0.2 - June 26, 2019

- published initial Memfault SDK, see `README.md` in root for summary
- published **panics** API which is a C SDK that can be integrated into any
  Cortex-M device to save a "core" (crash state) on faults and system asserts.
  See`components/panics/README.md` for more details
- Added example port and demo of **panics** SDK for the BCM943364WCD1 evaluation
  board running the WICED Wifi stack. More details in
  `platforms/wiced/README.md`
- add python invoke based CLI wrapper for demo ports
